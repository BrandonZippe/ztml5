				<h3 class="lyricTitle">Patiently Painful</h3>
					<p>The hardest part is watching you go. Knowing tomorrow I will wake up alone. You'll never see the emotion I bleed. 'Cause I put on a smile to make you believe. That I'm alright baby when you're around. I'm alright baby when you're around. I'm alright baby when you're around.</p>
					<p>Patiently painful and you can't give in. Love has it's own way of making a mend. Listen to your heart at the end of the day. Find true love is ready to wait. 'Cause it will all be worth it when you're around. It will all be worth it when you're around. It will all be worth it when you're around.</p>
					<p>We share our love through the telephone wires. Before we dream that the time has expired. I reach for the shadow at that you left in my room. Only to find where loneliness blooms. But I'm alright baby when you're around. I'm alright baby when you're around. I'm alright baby when you're around.</p>
					<p>Patiently painful and you can't give in. Love has it's own way of making a mend. Listen to your heart at the end of the day. Somehow find a way to endure loves pain. 'Cause it will all be worth it when you're around. It will all be worth it when you're around. It will all be worth it when you're around.</p>
					<p>Serenity hides in the back of my mind. Waiting for the distance to swallow the time.</p>
					<p>Serenity hides in the back of my mind. Waiting for the distance to swallow the time.</p>
					<p>Serenity hides in the back of my mind. Waiting for the distance to swallow the time.</p>
					<p>Serenity hides in the back of my mind. Waiting for the distance to swallow the time.</p>
					<p>Patiently painful and you can't give in. Love has it's own way of making a mend. Listen to your heart at the end of the day. When you find true love but have to wait.</p>

				<h3 class="lyricTitle">Blue Side</h3>
					<p>You said it's over but I can't find. Reason's you left me trace my mind. I must of slipped on the bottom line. Drowning in sorrows of wasted time.</p>
					<p>Yesterday I lost. What you found today. Tomorrow I may find. What someone lost today. I'm working my way through loves blue side. Trying to break free from the tide. I'm working my way through loves blue side. Trying to break free from the tide.</p>
					<p>Love has a best friend. He goes by pain. All of these places whisper your name. Struggle to break free. But still I remain. Trapped in the circle of loves little game.</p>
					<p>Yesterday I lost. What you found today. Tomorrow I may find. What someone lost today. I'm working my way through loves blue side. Trying to break free from the tide. I'm working my way through loves blue side. Trying to break free from the tide.</p>
					<p>You're just a memory tangled in my mind. Lost in a dream I can't find. We shared more than just a first kiss. How do I get back to the day we first met.</p>

				<h3 class="lyricTitle">PM (Kyndalls Song)</h3>
					<p>Sometimes when life unfolds. We're unsure on where to go. We will always need a hand. When we misconstrue the plans.</p>
					<p>I felt down and out. Living a life full of doubt. Then. I got the word. It's gonna be a baby girl. Nine months by her side. And a father emerged.</p>
					<p>Perfect mistake. My last shot with faith. It's safe to say she's my saving grace.</p>
					<p>Perfect mistake. My last shot with faith. It's safe to say she's my saving grace.</p>
					<p>Ever since her eyes grabbed ahold of me. I've learned to set aside my history. Nothing in this world could keep me from my girl. She doesn't know it yet. That she is my world.</p>
					<p>Perfect mistake. My last shot with faith. It's safe to say she's my saving grace.</p>
					<p>Perfect mistake. My last shot with faith. It's safe to say she's my saving grace.</p>
					<p>You may be confused by the words I chose to use. So when you hear this song. I hope you understand the truth. You were not the plan until I held you in my hands. Ever since that day. I am forever changed.</p>
					<p>Perfect mistake. My last shot with faith. It's safe to say she's my saving grace.</p>
					<p>Perfect mistake. My last shot with faith. It's safe to say she's my saving grace.</p>

					<h3 class="lyricTitle">Autumn</h3>
						<p>Autumns leaves have come and gone. I fear your heart has too. The weather changed before our eyes. Now my view's obscured. We wait so long to fall in love. But quickly let it stray. We wait so long to fall in love. To let it dissipate.</p>
						<p>The wind has changed directions. Our hearts remain the same. The line was drawn. We crossed it. Running away from pain. You can take love out of the picture. But pain will stake its claim. If you take love out of the picture. Whats left but a lonely frame.</p>
						<p>Love. Only works in twos. You can't be loved. Until you've loved. The one that loves you too.</p>
						<p>Love. Only works in twos. You can't be loved. Until you've loved. The one that loves you too.</p>
						<p>Love. Only works in twos. You can't be loved. Until you've loved. The one that loves you too.</p>
						<p>The sun has fallen. Prisoner to the sea. I wonder if the stars regret. Choosing to be seen. All you need is love. Is really just a lie. All you need is love. Is just a way to get by.</p>
